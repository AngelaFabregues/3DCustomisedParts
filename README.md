## squaredMapPieceFrame
There is a board game where players build a map up from squared pieces of it. It is very difficult for little kids to place a piece without moving the already placed pieces of the map.

This frame should hold the placed pieces among themselves. It should also be easy for a little kid to place a new piece.

This is the result. In the picture you can see two frames placed together. Only one of the frames has the map piece attached to it.
