## squaredMapPieceFrame
There is a board game where players build a map up from squared pieces of it. It is very difficult for little kids to place a piece without moving the already placed pieces of the map.
This frame should hold the placed pieces among themselves. It should also be easy for a little kid to place a new piece.
